# Notes

I watched the Google CTF 2019 ad on YouTube. I have watched it a few times before (I like the trap music...) but I didn't notice the flag that was overlayed on a single frame previously.

Thankfully YouTube on PC supports single-frame stepping, so I was able to find the flag and transcribe it:
```
CTF{9e796ca74932912c216a1cd00c25c84fae00e139}
```
