# Notes

Opened in R2, looks like the program reads through an internal list of destinations or something. I've skipped over most of the logic and found where it prints out the flag (stored in plaintext):
```
CTF{welcome_to_googlectf}
```

I should go back later and do a more complete reversing, there's probably something interesting with the actual code...
